Installation
============

Compatibility
-------------

* Python 3.4 and 3.5

.. Note::

    **Linux-x64** is the only (officially) supported platform.
    To build the binaries for other platforms, the ``./dev`` steps
    must be adapted (probably to vagrant instead of docker) accordingly.
    PRs are welcome.

Pip
---

Latest version can be installed through pip::

    $ pip install v8-cffi
